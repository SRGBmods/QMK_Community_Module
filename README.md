This is an early Work In Progress (WIP) Community module for QMK firmware allowing users to import this module in the userspace as a submodule and include SignalRGB's protocol.

I highly recommend reading the [documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/features/community_modules) on how to import and build with this.
